# SQL-Code-Alongs
Code-Alongs for SQL. These code snippets are from my work in an online SQL class. 
These are meant as a teaching tool so that people can read through them who 
may have no experience with SQL. The database that is used is the 'employees' database and can be downloaded
by following the instructions found here https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees-installation.html
NOTE: You need to have installed MySQL Workbench to code along with these. One can download the workbench by 
following the instructions here https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
