#Now LEFT JOIN
#LEFT JOIN will return all rows from the first table that do not match the rows from the other table
#In addition, it will return the rows that do match, just like an INNER JOIN would
#The order that you JOIN tables matters!

LEFT JOIN departments_dup as d
ON d.dept_no = m.dept_no

#switch order of tables, retrieve the first column from the first table!
#BTW, you could also use LEFT OUTER JOIN, they are interchangeable, but you shouldn't type OUTER, its always OUTER with LEFT or RIGHT
SELECT d.dept_no, m.emp_no, d.dept_name
FROM departments_dup as d
LEFT JOIN dept_manager_dup as m
ON d.dept_no = m.dept_no
ORDER BY dept_no;
#examine the differences yourself

#retrieve the records that contain Nulls after the JOIN using a WHERE IS NULL clause
SELECT m.dept_no, m.emp_no, d.dept_name
FROM dept_manager_dup as m
LEFT JOIN departments_dup as d
ON d.dept_no = m.dept_no
WHERE dept_name IS NULL

#Exercise, Join the 'employees' and the 'dept_manager' tables to return a subset of all the employees whose last name is Markovitch. 
#See if the output contains a manager with that name. 
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.from_date, d.dept_no, d.emp_no 
FROM employees as e
JOIN dept_manager as d
ON e.emp_no = d.emp_no
WHERE e.last_name = 'Markovitch'
ORDER BY dept_no, emp_no;

#RIGHT JOIN, the same exact funcitonality as LEFT JOIN but the process is inverted
#again, RIGHT OUTER JOIN is the same thing
#NOTICE, if we substitute 'm' and 'd' out in the first column being selected (i.e. d.dept_no) we get a different output
#each time, why is this? its becuase we are using the dept_no from the departments_dup table instead of the one from 
#dept_manager
SELECT d.dept_no, m.emp_no, d.dept_name
FROM dept_manager_dup as m
RIGHT JOIN departments_dup as d
ON d.dept_no = m.dept_no
ORDER BY dept_no;

#NOTE: RIGHT JOINS ARE RARELY APPLIED IN PRACTICE! This is due to the fact that you can simply invert the joined tables 
#in a LEFT JOIN and the outpute would be exactly the same!
